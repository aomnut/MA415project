# MA415project

# There are five files in total for this final project. To make it easier to look, I basically extract the plotting part into a "result.rmd" file and also include a pdf report as well. The shiny link is at the end of the report file. And in case if there is a problem with my shiny, I include a full data file, app.R. 
# Lastly, the file "epl_analysis1.Rmd" is the full code including all data collecting method, data cleaning, and plotiting.
